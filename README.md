OBS Live Captions
=================

- This is a work in progress. Might be some bumps. Definitely needs more documentation. 

- This script provides live catptions via the Web Speech API

- You'll need to use a browser that supports the API. Google Chrome does. Your milage may vary on other browsers. 

- The reason for the jump through web sockets is to allow you to use transparency in the browser window. 

- This works with Python 3.7+

- Install the requirements with:

        pip install -r requirements.txt 

- Some config options are at the top of the python file 

- When you run the file, open your browser to the domain:port defined in the config section

- The URL for the OBS browser source is `domain:port/obs` as defined in the config section
